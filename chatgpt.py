TEXT = '''One thing that I found frustrating, 
is that the AI doesnâ€™t always give the same answer for the same text. 
If I ask it to process a piece of text multiple times, 
I will sometimes get slightly different answers for the same piece of text. 
Unfortunately, I think this is actually by design since LLMs are designed 
to reply to you like a person would, which means they vary what they say.
